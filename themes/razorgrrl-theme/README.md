This is the repository for my custom Hugo theme that I use on my blog. It is designed to be Javascript-light, but still stylish, responsive and with as little FOUC as possible. The design principle is based around mixing the retro with the modern. Key elements (site title, post titles) are placed in the foreground using a simple high-contrast color scheme, and denser secondary content (the content of the posts themselves) uses more muted colors so that the content is still readable.

The name of the theme is inspired by William Gibson's _Neuromancer_ and the character Molly Millions.

# Configuration
Swapping out color schemes and fonts can easily be done by changing the variables in `static/css/style.scss` and compiling to `style.min.css`.

The `config.template.toml` file can be used as a guide for all the required variables that the theme needs, just make sure to move it into the root of your Hugo repository and rename it to `config.toml`. In the future, this will be automated with a bash script.

A few notes about configuration:
- The `description` variable is markdownified
- The `docsrepo` variable is where you link the git repo with all the markdown source of your posts, if you wish to do this. If not, you can remove Repo link section at the bottom of `layouts/_default/baseof.html`
- The `siterepo` variable is for linking to the subdirectory of your writings repo if you have the markdown source in a subdirectory where the `docsrepo` variable links to (for instance, in my case I have multiple sites and multiple subdirectories in my writings repo). If `docsrepo` isn't filled out, you'll want to also remove the Download link section from `layouts/_default/single.html`
- The `license` variable is for linking to whatever license you have licensed your writings under if you use a Creative Commons license, and the `licenseimg` variable is for linking to one of the images they provide to let your readers know that your writings are licensed under Creative Commons. If you don't want to have a license, you can remove the License section in `layouts/_default/single.html`
- The `[params.navigation]` section is for navigation links for your site (such as home, archives, about page); you can add as many additional `[[params.navigation.list]]` params as you like as long as they have the same structure
- The `[params.contact]` section is for links to ways to contact you, donation links, etc. You can add as many `[[params.contact.list]]` params as you like as long as they have the same structure. The theme uses [fork awesome](https://forkawesome.github.io/Fork-Awesome/), and the `icon` variable takes the class tag for any icon that you'd like to use in for an item in the contact links list (I left twitter filled in as an example).
